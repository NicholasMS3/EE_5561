## Other Github Ideas for Medical Imaging

1. Pneumonia detection from X-ray images using **Tensor Flow** Convolution Neural Network (https://github.com/sanghvirajit/Medical-Image-Classification-using-CNN/tree/main)
2. **PyTorch and CUDA** Chest X-rays Medical Image Diagnosis usnig CNN (https://github.com/roshansadath/Medical-Image-Diagnosis-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks)
3. Random chect x-ray medical imaging github (https://github.com/lokeshBI/Medical-Image-Processing/tree/master)
4. Random "Efficient Brain Tumor Detection for Early Intervention with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" (https://github.com/HassanMahmoodKhan/Efficient-Brain-Tumor-Detection-for-Early-Intervention)
5. CBIM-Medical-Image-Segmentation (https://github.com/yhygao/CBIM-Medical-Image-Segmentation)
   * **Pytorch**
   * Another repo that used this same one (https://github.com/medical-images-process/CNN-Transformer?tab=readme-ov-file)

## Githubs with Tons of Paper Links 

1. Links for 100 papers from 2012-2016 (too old?) "Awesome - Most Cited Deep Learning Papers" (https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers)
2. Source with more Deep Learning Papers on Medical Image Analysis (https://github.com/albarqouni/Deep-Learning-for-Medical-Applications/tree/master)

## Survey Papers
1. Big boi from 2021 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231221001314)

## PyTorch
1. Interesting library for PyTorch that helps read in medical images specifically. Maybe could be implemented on top of whatever idea we end up choosing to improve the efficiency of handling the dataset (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260721003102)
2. Another PyTorch add-on, but for image segmentation (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169260723000652)
