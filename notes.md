5. CBIM-Medical-Image-Segmentation (https://github.com/yhygao/CBIM-Medical-Image-Segmentation)
   * **Pytorch**
   * Another repo that used this same one (https://github.com/medical-images-process/CNN-Transformer?tab=readme-ov-file)
6. This is a cool project from Facebook/NYU for "faster" MRIs with lots of support, examples, and some datasets (https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI/)

## Githubs with Tons of Paper Links 
1. Links for 100 papers from 2012-2016 (too old?) "Awesome - Most Cited Deep Learning Papers" (https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers)
2. Source with more Deep Learning Papers on Medical Image Analysis (https://github.com/albarqouni/Deep-Learning-for-Medical-Applications/tree/master)

## Survey Papers
1. Big boi from 2021 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231221001314)

## PyTorch Frameworks and Add-Ons
1. Framework built on top of PyTorch specifically for medical images, includes a tutorial for spinal cord gray matter sengmentation (https://github.com/perone/medicaltorch)
2. Another framework built on top of PyTorch. This is a popular one and more recent but not all documentation is complete (https://github.com/nitrain/nitrain/tree/main). There are tutorials for both 2D and 3D computations (https://github.com/nitrain/tutorials/tree/main)
3. Yet another framework, also very new and seems to have good examples (https://github.com/HiLab-git/PyMIC)
4. Older but popular and recently updated 3D computation framework with an example and cool GIF output code (https://github.com/ellisdg/3DUnetCNN/tree/master)
5. Interesting library for PyTorch that helps read in medical images specifically. Maybe could be implemented on top of whatever idea we end up choosing to improve the efficiency of handling the dataset if something similar is not already done (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260721003102 / https://github.com/fepegar/torchio)
